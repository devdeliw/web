Hi, I am currently a sophomore in college. In my free time I like to code
elegant math & physics explanatory videos on my youtube
[channel](https://youtube.com/@devdeliw). My primary interests lie in Quantum
Computing -- presently learning the Qiskit Python Library. I also perform
research using JWST data analyzing the dynamics of stars and blackholes around
the galactic center.

Other than that, I like nature, calisthenics, watching 3b1b videos...
